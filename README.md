# Posts App

 ## Overview

This project integrates a mock API to perform CRUD operations on posts. 
The application is built using **React**, with state management handled by **Redux Toolkit (RTK)**, 
and UI components styled using **Material-UI (MUI)**.

> **Note:** This project was developed as part of my internship at [Syntheia](https://syntheia.io).
